This project is meant to simulate two players playing a game to see the stastical results of how to best play the game. The game is called UnoWar, and the rules are as follows:
Each player has a hand of 5 cards.
The game starts by dealing a card from the deck onto a pile in the middle. Players then take turns
playing a card from their hand. The card they play must have the same suit, as the card in the
middle, or the same or higher rank. Play goes back and forth until one of the players is unable to
play a card. At that point the other player gets one point. The first player to 10 points wins. 
After a player plays a card they always draw a replacement (so hands always have 5 cards) and
if the deck is ever empty â€“ it is immediately re-shuffled (so the players can always draw another
card). (In our computer simulation we will reshuffle with a new set of 52 cards, however, in real-life
play only the cards not being used would be shuffled)

Several things were learned when implementing this project:
-How to implement Lists
-create basic AI's to play with simple strategies
-Extensive use of objects

Three different AI strategies were implemented:
-One which just chooses a card at random to play
-One which chooses the smallest ranked card to play
-One which chooses the largest ranked card to play

If you want to see how this program works, run tournament.java.
